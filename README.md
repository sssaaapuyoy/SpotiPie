Configure the script: Open the script and update the SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, and SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI with your credentials.

How to Run the Script
Windows
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Navigate to the folder where you saved the script:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
cd path\to\spotify-playlist-downloader
Run the script using Python:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
python download_playlist.py
Enter the Spotify playlist URL when prompted.
The script will authenticate with Spotify, fetch track details, and ask if you want to download the songs. Enter "Y" to proceed.
The tracks will be downloaded to a new folder named after the playlist.
Linux and Mac
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
cd /path/to/spotify-playlist-downloader
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and the required libraries installed:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
python3 -m pip install spotipy spotdl
Run the script:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
python3 download_playlist.py
Enter the Spotify playlist URL when prompted.
The script will authenticate with Spotify, fetch track details, and ask if you want to download the songs. Enter "Y" to proceed.
The tracks will be downloaded to a new folder named after the playlist.
Notes:
OAuth Authorization: The first time you run the script, you’ll be asked to authorize the application to access your Spotify account. Follow the URL in your terminal, log in to your Spotify account, and allow the requested permissions. Once you do that, you’ll receive an authorization code which you can paste back into the terminal.

Parallel Downloads: By default, the script downloads multiple tracks at the same time using threads for faster performance. The script will show the total number of successfully downloaded tracks at the end.

Spotdl Configuration: If you need to adjust the way spotdl downloads the music (for example, setting the quality), you can modify the spotdl settings in your environment or configure it via the command line options.

Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling, including issues with retrieving playlist information from Spotify or downloading individual tracks.

Troubleshooting
spotdl not found: If you encounter errors related to spotdl not being recognized, ensure it is installed globally with pip install spotdl or try running spotdl from the command line to verify it works correctly.

Spotify authentication error: If you receive an authentication error, make sure your SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, and SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI are correct and properly set.

Error during track download: If a track fails to download, check that the URL is valid and that you have access to the track via your Spotify account.
