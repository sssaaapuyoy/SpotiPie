# Spotify Playlist Downloader üéµ

Welcome to **SpotiPie**! This Python script allows you to download all tracks from any Spotify playlist using the **spotdl** tool. The script fetches track details using the **Spotify API**, then downloads the songs in parallel, making the process faster and more efficient.

---

## Features üöÄ

- **Spotify API Integration**: Fetches playlist track details using Spotify's Web API.
- **Parallel Downloads**: Utilizes Python's **ThreadPoolExecutor** to download multiple tracks simultaneously.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**.
- **Spotdl Tool**: Downloads tracks in high-quality MP3 format using the **spotdl** command-line tool.
- **User-Friendly**: Interactive prompts guide you throughout the process.

## Cons ‚ö†Ô∏è

While SpotiPie is a powerful tool, please consider the following drawbacks:

- **Spotdl Dependency**: The script relies on **spotdl**, which depends on third-party services. Occasionally, **spotdl** might encounter errors or not support certain track types or regions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Spotify's API can impose rate limits. Downloading too many tracks in a short period may result in temporary blocks or errors.
- **No Built-In Error Recovery**: Failed downloads are not automatically retried; you may need to re-run the script or download problematic tracks manually.
- **Not Ideal for Large Playlists**: Large playlists may take considerable time to process, even with parallel downloads.
- **Manual Spotify Authentication**: First-time users must manually authenticate the application, which might be confusing for those new to the Spotify API.
- **Legal Concerns**: Downloading tracks may violate Spotify's terms of service and copyright laws. Use responsibly.
- **Only Your Own Playlists**: The script can download only playlists that you own or have created, not public playlists that you do not own, due to Spotify API limitations.
